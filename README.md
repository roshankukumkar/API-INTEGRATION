##This is a simple weather webpage created during my internship at CodTech. The webpage lets users enter the name of any Indian city and shows the current temperature and weather condition for that city.
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses a free weather API called wttr.in. The data is loaded live from the internet when the user clicks the "Get Weather" button.
The webpage is responsive, which means it works well on phones, tablets, and computers. It also runs easily in VS Code using the Live Server extension.
This project helped me learn how to work with APIs and build interactive web pages using real-time data.
